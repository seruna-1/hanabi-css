<p>Hello, world.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Mateus. I am a 18 years old guy that lives in Brazil and likes to understand computers and software. I would say I am an amateur programmer and enjoyer of science, in general. Yeah, I am a nerd.</p><p>This is my personal website. Here, there is pretty much of anything.</p><p>This hole domain is a git repository, hosted by Codeberg and also by Github. At these sites, you can access the source code of my site and of other projects of mine.</p><p>I must admit, I begin more projects than I finish, but, maybe, you can find something interesting here.</p><p>About this thing o showing something unfinished, it is cool to see something conceptual and clumsy getting shape as time passes.</p><p>If you want to contact me, you can send me an email. Here is my email adress</p><p>O-drawing-collection/OO2.avif</p><p>OO2</p><p>OO-drawing-collection/index.html</p></main>
